                    I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science (AIML) student with strong skills in Python, SQL, and data
                    analytics, and a solid understanding of software development best practices and SDLC. I have
                    hands-on experience working on academic and internship projects involving data-driven applications,
                    dashboards, APIs, and machine learning models. I am eager to apply my analytical thinking,
                    programming skills, and problem-solving abilities in a Data Analyst or Technology Analyst role to
                    support real-world, data-informed decision-making.
